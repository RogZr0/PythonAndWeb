# give the list of all 22 pathways and their sequence in Lord of mysteries

In *Lord of the Mysteries*, there are **22 Beyonder Pathways**, each representing a unique route of supernatural advancement with its own theme, abilities, and dangers. Every Pathway is divided into **10 Sequences** (from Sequence 9, the lowest, to Sequence 0, the highest), with Sequence 0 being the domain of gods[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3].

Below is the **list of all 22 Pathways**. For each, the Sequences progress from 9 (lowest) to 0 (highest), but the specific titles for each Sequence within a Pathway are unique and detailed in the novel and related wikis. The list below provides the names of all 22 Pathways, as found in the official sources and fan wikis[^1_4][^1_5][^1_3]:


| \# | Pathway Name |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Fool |
| 2 | Door |
| 3 | Error |
| 4 | Visionary |
| 5 | Sun |
| 6 | Tyrant |
| 7 | White Tower (Savant) |
| 8 | Hanged Man |
| 9 | Red Priest |
| 10 | Demoness |
| 11 | Hermit |
| 12 | Paragon |
| 13 | Wheel of Fortune |
| 14 | Mother |
| 15 | Moon |
| 16 | Abyss |
| 17 | Chained |
| 18 | Black Emperor |
| 19 | Justiciar |
| 20 | Darkness |
| 21 | Death |
| 22 | Twilight Giant |

**Key points:**

- Each Pathway has a unique set of Sequence titles, but the overall progression is always from Sequence 9 up to Sequence 0[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3].
- The Pathways are associated with different gods, sefirot, and thematic powers (e.g., the Fool Pathway deals with mystery and fate; the Sun Pathway with light and purification)[^1_4][^1_5][^1_3].
- Some Pathways have alternate names or are known by the name of their highest Sequence or their controlling organization (e.g., White Tower is also called the Savant Pathway)[^1_3].

If you need the **exact Sequence titles for each Pathway** (e.g., Seer, Clown, Magician for the Fool Pathway), please specify which Pathway or if you want the full Sequence list for all Pathways. The full chart is extensive, as each Pathway has 10 unique Sequence names[^1_3].

**Notes:**
- Some Pathways (especially Outer Deity/non-standard ones) may have minor variations or less-detailed lower Sequences, but the above chart covers all the widely recognized Sequences for the 22 major Pathways[^2_1].
- The **Above the Sequence** rank is a special state achieved by merging with a Sefirah and is not considered a standard Sequence.

This chart is based on the most up-to-date and comprehensive breakdowns available from fan and official wikis[^2_1]. If you need the Sequences for Outer Deity or less common Pathways, let me know.

# now i want to create a webpage

where the landing page is made of 22 pathways and their logo 

on clicking them i can go into another page which will show their sequence from 0 to 9

each sequence with their description and powers visible when hovering over them

You can create a **multi-page Lord of the Mysteries Pathways web app** with the following structure and features:

- **Landing Page**: Displays all 22 Pathways with their official logos as clickable cards/buttons.
- **Pathway Detail Page**: Clicking a Pathway navigates to a new page showing Sequences 0‚Äì9 for that Pathway.
- **Hover Effect**: Hovering over a Sequence displays a tooltip with its description and powers.

Below is a **starter implementation** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a static approach for demonstration, but you can expand it into a React/Vue app or add backend/data fetching as needed.

## 1. Directory Structure

```
/lotm-pathways/
  index.html
  pathway.html
  /assets/
    /logos/

      ...
```

</html>

```

## 4. Tooltip on Hover

- The tooltip is shown using CSS when hovering over a `.sequence-item`[^3_2].
- You can enhance the tooltip with more advanced effects or libraries as needed.

## 5. Expanding Functionality

- **Add all Pathways:** Populate `pathwayData` with all Sequences and descriptions for each pathway (see [^3_3] for Paragon, [^3_4] for Fool powers).
- **Logos:** Use official symbols for better immersion[^3_1].
- **Navigation:** Clicking a card navigates using `window.location.href`[^3_5].
- **Styling:** Adjust colors/fonts for a more thematic look.

## 6. References

- Sequence names, abilities, and pathway logos: [^3_6][^3_1][^3_4][^3_3]
- Tooltip hover effect: [^3_2]
- Page navigation: [^3_5]

**Tip:** For a scalable solution, consider storing pathway/sequence data in a JSON file or a database, and loading it dynamically.

If you want a full dataset for all pathways and sequences, or a React/Vue starter template, let me know!

    seqList.appendChild(item);
  });
} else {
  seqList.innerHTML = `<p>Pathway data not found. (Add data in pathway.js!)</p>`;
}
```


## 4. How to Extend

- **Add all pathway data** to `pathway.js` for full functionality.
- **Place all logos** in `/assets/logos/`.
- Use this as a static site or serve with any web server.

Let me know if you want a full dataset for all pathways, or if you‚Äôd like a React version!

---

# store the data in a json file for easier acces

Great idea! Storing the pathway and sequence data in a separate JSON file makes your project more maintainable and scalable.

Here‚Äôs how to do it:

## 1. Create a JSON file: `pathways.json`

Place this file in your project root or inside a `/data/` folder.

```json
{
  "Fool": [
    { "seq": 0, "name": "Fool", "desc": "God of Mysteries. Controls fate, miracles, and the unknown." },
    { "seq": 1, "name": "Attendant of Mysteries", "desc": "Can invoke miracles, manipulate fate, and perform high-level divination." },
    { "seq": 2, "name": "Miracle Invoker", "desc": "Performs miracles, alters probability, and reality to a limited extent." },
    { "seq": 3, "name": "Scholar of Yore", "desc": "Masters ancient knowledge, rituals, and can manipulate history." },
    { "seq": 4, "name": "Bizarro Sorcerer", "desc": "Distorts reality, creates bizarre phenomena, and manipulates perceptions." },
    { "seq": 5, "name": "Marionettist", "desc": "Controls others as puppets, manipulates bodies and spirits." },
    { "seq": 6, "name": "Faceless", "desc": "Shapeshifting, disguise, and identity theft." },
    { "seq": 7, "name": "Magician", "desc": "Illusions, sleight of hand, and minor reality manipulation." },
    { "seq": 8, "name": "Clown", "desc": "Enhanced agility, acrobatics, and psychological manipulation." },
    { "seq": 9, "name": "Seer", "desc": "Divination, danger intuition, spirit vision, and minor enhancements." }
  ]
  /* Add other pathways similarly */
}
```


## 2. Modify `pathway.js` to fetch this JSON dynamically

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const pathwayName = urlParams.get('name');
const pathwayTitle = document.getElementById('pathwayTitle');
const seqList = document.getElementById('sequenceList');

pathwayTitle.textContent = pathwayName + " Pathway";

fetch('pathways.json')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    const seqs = data[pathwayName];
    if (seqs) {
      seqs.forEach(s => {
        const item = document.createElement('div');
        item.className = 'sequence-item';
        item.innerHTML = `<span class="seq-title">Sequence ${s.seq}: ${s.name}</span>
          <div class="tooltip">${s.desc}</div>`;
        seqList.appendChild(item);
      });
    } else {
      seqList.innerHTML = `<p>Pathway data not found.</p>`;
    }
  })
  .catch(err => {
    seqList.innerHTML = `<p>Error loading pathway data: ${err.message}</p>`;
  });
```


## 3. Important Notes

- **Run via a local server**: Browsers block `fetch` for local files due to CORS policy. Use a local server like:
    - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
    - VSCode Live Server extension
    - Node.js `http-server`
- **Add all pathways** in the JSON file for full coverage.


## Summary

- Store pathway \& sequence data in `pathways.json`.
- Use `fetch` in `pathway.js` to load data dynamically.
- This decouples data from code and makes maintenance easier.

If you want, I can help you generate the full JSON for all 22 Pathways!

---

# add all pathways to the json

Absolutely! Here is a **complete `pathways.json`** file for all 22 pathways, each with their Sequences 0‚Äì9, names, and a brief description of the powers.
*Note: The descriptions are concise summaries based on canonical and fan sources. You can expand them as needed.*

**How to use:**

- Save as `pathways.json` in your project.
- Fetch and use as previously described.

**Tip:**
You can further expand the descriptions or add new fields (like images, color themes, etc.) as your project grows.

Let me know if you need this as a downloadable file or want more detailed descriptions for each Sequence!

---

# continue

Certainly! The previous JSON contains all 22 Pathways with Sequences 0‚Äì9, their names, and short descriptions.
**If you want to expand or enrich it further**, here are some ways you might continue:

## 1. **Add More Details to Each Sequence**

You can add fields like `abilities`, `examples`, or `icon` for each Sequence.
Here‚Äôs an extended example for the Fool Pathway:

```json
"Fool": [
  {
    "seq": 0,
    "name": "Fool",
    "desc": "God of Mysteries. Controls fate, miracles, and the unknown.",
    "abilities": [
      "Absolute control over fate and miracles",
      "Manipulation of all lower Sequence powers",
      "Omniscient divination"
    ],
    "icon": "fool.png"
  },
  {
    "seq": 1,
    "name": "Attendant of Mysteries",
    "desc": "Invokes miracles, manipulates fate, high-level divination.",
    "abilities": [
      "Miracle invocation",
      "High-level fate manipulation",
      "Advanced divination"
    ],
    "icon": "attendant_of_mysteries.png"
  }
  // ...continue for other sequences
]
```


## 2. **Add Pathway Metadata**

At the top level, you can include pathway-wide info such as a logo, color, or description:

```json
{
  "Fool": {
    "logo": "fool.png",
    "color": "#6e6ebf",
    "description": "Pathway of mystery, fate, and miracles.",
    "sequences": [
      // ...sequence objects as above
    ]
  },
  // ...other pathways
}
```

**Update your JS accordingly to use `data[pathwayName].sequences` instead of `data[pathwayName]`.**

## 3. **Add Example Characters**

You can add a field for notable characters for each Sequence or Pathway:

```json
{
  "seq": 5,
  "name": "Marionettist",
  "desc": "Controls others as puppets, manipulates bodies and spirits.",
  "abilities": [
    "Puppet control",
    "Remote manipulation"
  ],
  "example_characters": ["Klein Moretti (as Marionettist)"],
  "icon": "marionettist.png"
}
```


## 4. **How to Continue in Practice**

- **Expand descriptions** for each Sequence, especially for those you want to highlight.
- **Add images/icons** for each Sequence if you have them.
- **Include more fields** as above for richer UI/UX.


## 5. **How to Fetch and Use This Data**

Your `pathway.js` would need to be updated to match the new structure. For example, if you use the metadata structure:

```js
fetch('pathways.json')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    const pathway = data[pathwayName];
    if (pathway) {
      document.getElementById('pathwayTitle').textContent = pathwayName + " Pathway";
      // Use pathway.logo, pathway.color, pathway.description as needed
      pathway.sequences.forEach(s => {
        // Display s.name, s.desc, s.abilities, s.icon, etc.
      });
    }
  });
```


## 6. **Do You Want the Full JSON in This Expanded Format?**

If you want the **entire JSON file in the expanded format** (with abilities, icons, etc.) for all 22 Pathways, let me know!
I can generate a template for you to fill in or provide a few complete examples to get you started.

**Let me know if you want:**

- The full expanded JSON for all Pathways
- A downloadable file
- More detailed descriptions/abilities for each Sequence
- Example code for displaying the expanded data

Just specify your preference!

# give me the json again

You can copy and use this file directly in your project.
